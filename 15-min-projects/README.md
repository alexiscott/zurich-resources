## String: delete even, swap odd

You have:

- a sentence,
- a keyword.

Delete all letters in the sentence that have an even position in the keyword and switch with the next letter all the ones that have an odd position.

If you have

- the "i am tired" sentence and 
- the "summer" keyword

You will get "i a tide".  
The first "m" is at place three in the keyword and get deletes. the "r" is at place six and gets switched with the following "e".

Notes:

- Pick your own sentence and keyword.
- The rules leave a certain degree of freedom: don't worry about it, and create the best program you can get in a short time...

  - integers (floats)
  - cin / cout
  - if
  - while
