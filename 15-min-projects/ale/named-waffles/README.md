# Serving named waffles

Aka: Darryl in [Brussels](https://github.com/roseTech/storycoder.dev/blob/main/Darryl_In_Brussels/Darryl_In_Brussels_Story.md)

I want to decorate special waffles for them with their names on them: One name per waffle. The names shall be written with fine Belgian chocolate letters that I bought. I bought six sets of letters (each set has 26 letters of the English Alphabet). I probably wonâ€™t have enough letters to write all their names.

    After which person in the below fixed line of programmers will I not be able to continue writing their names anymore?
    After said person, if I'm allowed to skip people, which names, still following below order, can I still write?

Line of programmers: Dennis, Aaron, Donald, Tim, Bjarne, Linus, Guido, James, Richard, Brian, Grace, Alan, Niklaus, Guy, Fabrice, Donald, Ken, John, Eric, Anders, Alexander, Charles, Alan, Ronald, Andrew, Leslie, Edsger, John, Keith, Barbara

## The original story

The original story, asked for the order that serves the higehst number of programmers.  
Which is a hard problem to solve!
